# Image-Recognition-
This code is a convolutional neural net that is used for object recognition in Matlab. An image is sent in and goes through a series of layers to get a final output that can determine what class of object the image is. This project used the very well known CIFAR-10 dataset as it is well studied and works well for a simple image recognition program.
The neueral net implemented in this code is implemented in 18 stages. The main functions are Imnormalize, Convolve, ReLU, Maxpool, Fullconnect and Softmax.
